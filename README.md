**Github Actions CI/CD**

## Github Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration service that allows developers to automate tasks related to their code repositories. With GitHub Actions, developers can build, test, and deploy their code directly from their Git repositories, saving time and improving their workflow. Some common use cases for GitHub Actions include building and testing code, releasing software, and deploying code to production. GitHub Actions is available to all GitHub users and is free to use for public repositories.

## Github Workflows

GitHub Workflows are a way to automate tasks that you use in your software development workflows. Workflows are made up of individual Jobs, which are defined by a series of steps. Each step in a job can run a script, an action, or an external command. 

- Workflows can be triggered by a variety of events, such as pushes to a repository, the creation of a pull request, or the opening of an issue.

- GitHub Workflows are automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub. You can create Workflows by defining them in a .github/workflows directory in your repository.

Here are a few examples of Workflows that you could use:

1. Build and test: This Workflow could be triggered whenever you push new code to your repository. It could run your test suite to ensure that the code is working as expected, and then build a production-ready version of your code.

2. Release: This Workflow could be triggered whenever you create a new release tag in your repository. It could build and package your code, and then upload the package to a package repository or a deployment service.

3. Deploy: This Workflow could be triggered whenever you push new code to a specific branch (e.g. production). It could build and package your code, and then deploy it to your production environment.

Here is an example of a simple Workflow that builds and tests a Node.js project using npm:

    name: Build and Test

    on: [push]

    jobs:
        build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
                - uses: actions/checkout@v2
                - name: Use Node.js
                  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
                with:
                    node-version: 12.x
                - run: npm install
                - run: npm test

This Workflow is triggered whenever you push new code to your repository, and it runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. It checks out the code, sets up a Node.js environment, installs the dependencies, and then runs the test suite.
